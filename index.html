      <p>Distant flickerings, <span class="emphasis">greener scenery</span><br>
      This <span class="powerful">weather</span> is bringing it all back again<br>
      Great <span class="highlight">adventures</span>, faces and condensation<br>
      I'm going <span class="strong">outside</span> to take it all in</p>
      
      <p>You say too late to start, got your <span class="highlight1">heart</span> in a <span class="highlight">headlock</span><br>
      I don't <span class="powerful">believe</span> any of it<br>
      You say too late to start, with your <span class="highlight1">heart</span> in a <span class="highlight">headlock</span><br>
      You know you're <span class="strong">better</span> than this</p>
      
      <p>Wear a different pair, do something out of step<br>
      Throw a stranger an unexpected <span class="emphasis">smile</span><br>
      With big <span class="highlight">intention</span>, still posted at your station<br>
      Always on about the day it should have flown</p>
      
      <p>You say too late to start, got your <span class="highlight1">heart</span> in a <span class="highlight">headlock</span><br>
      I don't believe any of it
      You say too late to start, with your <span class="highlight1">heart</span> in a <span class="highlight">headlock</span>
      You know you're <span class="strong">better</span> than this
      Afraid to start, got your heart in a headlock
      I don't <span class="powerful">believe</span> any of it<br>
      You say too late to start, with your <span class="highlight1">heart</span> in a <span class="highlight">headlock</span>
      You know you're <span class="strong">better</span> than this</p>
      
      <p>I'm walking, you've been hiding
      And you look half dead half the time
      Monitoring you, like machines do
      You've still got it, I'm just keeping an eye
      I've been walking, you've been hiding
      And you look half dead half the time
      Monitoring you, like machines do
      You've still got it, I'm just keeping an eye</p>
      
      <p>You know you're <span class="strong">better</span> than this</p>
      
      <p>Can't start, got your <span class="highlight1">heart</span> in a <span class="highlight">headlock</span><br>
      No, I don't <span class="powerful">believe</span> any of it<br>
      You say too late to start, with your <span class="highlight1">heart</span> in a <span class="highlight">headlock</span>
      You know you're <span class="strong">better</span> than this
      Afraid to start, got your heart in a headlock
      I don't <span class="powerful">believe</span> any of it<br>
      You say too late to start, with your <span class="highlight1">heart</span> in a <span class="highlight">headlock</span>
      You know you're <span class="strong">better</span> than this</p>
